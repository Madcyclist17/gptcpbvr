# operator overloading can be done using 4 approaches
1. unary operator overloading       (member function)
2. binary operator overloading      (member function)
3. unary operator overloading       (friend function)
4. binary operator overloading      (friend function)

# unary operators (single operand)
1. increment(++) and decrement(--) operators
2. unary minus(-) operator 
3. logical (!) operator

# unary operator 
1. member - no arguement 
2. friend - one arguement with & operator

# binary operator 
1. member - one arguement 
2. friend - 2 arguements

# unary operator 
unary opertor can be prefix or postfix. Prefix need to assign the data to the function first. so need datatype as argument in unary operator overloading function.          complex operator++(int){}
